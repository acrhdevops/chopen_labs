Swarm Lab

- Checkout this repo
- Import the project into Eclipse
- Run docker compose $ docker-compose up on the terminal (folder which contains docker-compose.yml)
  (this starts a Postgres DB)
- Add transations to Swarm
- Needs the transactions fraction installed
- Load Recipe-Ingredients without eager fetch
 (needs a TX boundary on the REST endpoint in RecipeResource)
